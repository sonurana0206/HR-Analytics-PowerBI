# 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 📚 Project Overview  
This project is part of an **assignment in my CloudyML online Data Analyst course**. The goal was to analyze employee data and create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with meaningful insights for HR decision-making.  

Starting with a raw CSV dataset, I performed data transformation using **Power Query** and built visualizations that highlight workforce demographics, job distribution, tenure, and salary insights.

## 🛠️ Data Processing Steps  
I used **Power Query Editor** in Power BI to clean and enhance the data. The following calculated columns were added:

- `Tenure` – Duration of employment since joining  
- `Day Joined` – Day of the week employee joined  
- `Month Joined` – Month of joining  
- `HRA` – House Rent Allowance  
- `PF` – Provident Fund  
- `Net Salary` – Final calculated salary

## 📊 Dashboard Insights  
The Power BI dashboard contains several interactive visuals and charts, including:

- 👩‍💼 **Gender Distribution** – Breakdown of employees by gender  
- 📆 **Tenure Analysis** – Distribution based on length of service  
- 🧑‍🔧 **Job Classification Counts** – Number of employees in each job category  
- 📅 **Month Joining Count** – Employees joined per month  
- 📆 **Day of Week Joining Count** – Hiring trends by day of the week  

These visuals help HR teams understand workforce patterns and make data-driven decisions.
